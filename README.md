# Lets get the burger of the day

Bob's Burger's is known for their running gag of creative intros and burgers of the day. This website allows users to enter a number and see the respective burger of the day as well as showing them characters who first appeared in that episode.

**Link to project:** https://burger-of-day-bobs.netlify.app/

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

I am learning to use the async/await asynchronous promised base behavior with apis. The number that the user enters represents the number of a burger of the day, I then find the respsective episode and create a list of characters from that episode.

## Optimizations

Need to sanitize some of the values that the api gives in order to better display the voice actors of characters for a specific episode not all episodes they have done. I would also like to add local storage or use node.js in order to make the website more useful by storing the reponses.

## Lessons Learned:

I refactored my original code which was based on functional programming into the oop style of programing. I learned how to more efficiently inherit values from other methods to be used later, and to abstract away long and complex methods into shorter more specific ones.
